# dir_recon
A simple bash script that helps automate web application directory reconnaissance. 

This simple script uses three tools/dependencies: 

1. Sublist3r - https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r
2. ProbeThis -  https://github.com/shobhit99/probethis
3. Feroxbuster - https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster

If you're running a VPN, you may run into issues with Feroxbuster. 

The tool is incredibly simple to use and additional features (adjusting option flags) will be added at a future date.

-- Usage -- 
./dirrecon.sh <$URL>
